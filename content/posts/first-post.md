## Introduction to the Microsoft 365 Blog

This blog is dedicated to the practical side of Microsoft 365 in enterprise environments, with the focus on SharePoint and its surrounding technologies - Search, Copilot, Purview, Teams, OneDrive, Viva Engage, Entra etc. Drawing from nearly 20 years of hands-on experience — from SharePoint on-prem to SharePoint Online — I share lessons learned, governance strategies, automation techniques, and tenant-wide optimization practices. Whether you're an engineer, architect, or IT leader, you'll find actionable insights on managing large-scale SharePoint deployments, navigating Microsoft 365 integrations, and staying ahead in a rapidly evolving collaboration landscape. No buzzwords, no politics — just real SharePoint engineering.
