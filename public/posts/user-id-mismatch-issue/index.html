    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p><strong>Overview</strong><br>
A common issue in SharePoint, known as <strong>User ID Mismatch</strong>, occurs when a user account is deleted from the directory and later recreated with the same UPN (User Principal Name). This often happens when an employee is rehired or returned from a long leave or when a common name like <em>John Smith</em> is reused. In short, reusing a username in the directory can trigger a User ID Mismatch in SharePoint.</p>
<p><strong>Symptoms - Scenario 1:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A user requests access to a site.</li>
<li>The site owner approves the request.</li>
<li>The user still cannot access the site and receives <strong>“Access Denied”</strong> error.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Symptoms - Scenario 2:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A site owner shares content with the user (shares link).</li>
<li>The user follows the link but gets <strong>“Access Denied”</strong> error.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-does-this-happen"><strong>Why Does This Happen?</strong></h2>
<p>SharePoint maintains its own user data in its database behind, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>UPN</li>
<li>Local Active Directory Id (SID)</li>
<li>Entra ID Object Id</li>
</ul>
<p>When a reused UPN attempts to access a site, SharePoint blocks access. This behavior is logical because:</p>
<ul>
<li>The system cannot confirm if the user is the same person (rehired) or a different person with the same name.</li>
<li>A rehired user may have a different role.</li>
<li>A completely different person should never automatically inherit previous permissions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Access must be re-granted manually. However, here’s the catch:<br>
When a site owner approves the new user’s access request, <strong>Microsoft does not update the user in the User Information List (UIL)</strong>. To the site owner and affected site user, it appears that access was granted, but in reality, it was not.</p>
<p>Instead of fixing this in the product, Microsoft provides a workaround: <strong>remove the old user from the UIL</strong>. Once the old user ID is removed, the new user ID can be added without issues.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="important-notes"><strong>Important Notes</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Deleting a user from the UIL does <strong>not</strong> remove all related data. For example, document history will still show the old username.</li>
<li>Each user or group on a site has a <strong>Site User ID</strong>, an integer starting from 1. Deleting and re-adding the same user retains the same Site User ID, but a reused UPN will get a different number.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="solutions-to-fix-the-user-id-mismatch"><strong>Solutions to Fix the User ID Mismatch</strong></h2>
<p>There are three main approaches:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Admin via Microsoft 365 Admin Center using Diagnostics tools</strong></li>
<li><strong>Site owner/admin via Site Settings and the <code>MembershipGroupId=0</code> trick</strong></li>
<li><strong>Site owner/admin using PowerShell</strong></li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3 id="fixing-with-microsoft-diagnostics"><strong>Fixing with Microsoft Diagnostics</strong></h3>
<p>Microsoft provides two diagnostics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Site User Mismatch Diagnostic</strong><br>
Validates internal users and guests who try to access SharePoint and OneDrive sites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check User Access Diagnostic</strong><br>
Performs similar verifications for internal users and guests.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you run these diagnostics:</p>
<ul>
<li>You provide the site URL and UPN.</li>
<li>The tool reports:<br>
<em>“We found a SharePoint site user with a mismatched ID. The user must be removed and re-shared with appropriate permissions.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The diagnostic can remove the mismatched user from the site. After removal, you must re-share the site with the user. This action deletes all previous permissions.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Microsoft not only removes the user from the UIL but also adds the new user (without permissions).</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="fixing-via-site-settings"><strong>Fixing via Site Settings</strong></h3>
<p>This method works for site owners or collection admins, but it’s practical only for sites with a small number of users.</p>
<p>Steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to:<br>
<strong>Site Settings → Site Permissions → Advanced Permissions</strong></li>
<li>Select any group, then in the browser address bar, change the <code>MembershipGroupId</code> to <code>0</code>:
<pre tabindex="0"><code>https://domain.sharepoint.com/teams/mySite/_layouts/15/people.aspx?MembershipGroupId=0
</code></pre></li>
<li>Find the user in the list and delete them:<br>
<strong>Actions → Delete User from Site Collection</strong></li>
</ol>
